Here's the Email I sent out: Hey oh!

So I'm starting the accountability group email.  My name's Morgan O'Leary, I'm currently in Washington DC (moving to Wisconsin again Saturday).  My favorite websites are youtube, yahoo, and elite daily.   My learning style is Kinesthetic and Read/Write. 

Here's my reflection file: https://github.com/rmhwow/phase_0_unit_1/blob/master/week_1/7_get_to_know_your_group/my_reflection.md 
Here's the index site: http://rmhwow.github.io
Here's the some of the other stuff on there: http://rmhwow.github.io/unit1_projects/dbc1.html
Here's my wireframe html page: http://rmhwow.github.io/unit1_projects/wireframe_sites.html

I think that's it.  Can't wait to see what you guys have been working on!

And Here's How I'm feeling about DBC Currently. 
 
 Okay so how I'm feeling about DBC.  Well, to be honest, slightly terrified and exhilarated all at once.  It's this huge rush of emotions when I figure out how to do something and even when I get frustrated it's not like I want to break down, but more I have to figure it out.  The frustration keeps me going. I'm nervous about the intensity. I'm nervous I won't be good enough to succeed, but this week has shown me there is a lot I know and a lot I need to learn. It's scary and fantastic all at once and I've never been more excited to learn. I'm nervous and scared but at the same time I want this. I want to succeed here, I want to work really hard, I want to fail small and often and learn from those failures and high five or make loud noises that freak everyone out at the cafe (I'm working on controlling this) everytime there's a success. It's time to overcome my own barriers :) 

2. Take a moment to reflect on reading other people's responses regarding their fears about DBC. How did that make you feel? Did you feel better, worse, or something else all together? How has your experience this week influenced your feelings? All feelings are welcome and ok. Just take a moment to think about it and write it down.
