## 2. [Open Source and Repo Setup](2_set_up_repo/readme.md) Reflection

* Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person
* Describe what open source means
* What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
* Assess the importance of using licenses
* What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

1.	First you go to Github.com and click on “make a new repository”.  Then you hill out the information such as name, description, privacy, and adding a license.  You want to make the repository public with a readme and license so that way other people can add one to what you work on.  Then you click “create repository” and then in the features section click “issues” so people can help you work out the issues there might be with your code.   To clone it so it’s on your computer you open the github app, click on your username on the left, then search the name of your new repository, once you find it click “clone to this computer.”

2. Open Source means that a developer can share their code with anyone and allow them to customize or work on it.  It allows software to be used, modified, and shared freely.   When you use Open Source Licensing though you still are protected.  Open source licensing makes sure that people still give you credit for the original work, but also means eliminates the step of giving special permission for people to change the coding. 
3. I think open source is an awesome concept.  While we are learning it seems like a perfect way to grow in our skills.  As we start making things that are bigger projects it would make me a little nervous because of I wouldn’t want people stealing my work, but I think it’s a cool concept. 
4.  Licenses both liberate and protect you as a developer.  They liberate you in the sense that anyone can help you with your code and share ideas.  They also protect you because what was originally your code is still your code and you will get credit as a collaborater with someone if they worked on that code. 
5.   I think this challenge helped solidify the difference between Github and Git.  At first I thought I was supposed to go into the Github app not github.com.
