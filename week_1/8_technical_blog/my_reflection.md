Reflect on the process of researching and writing a blog post. It doesn't have to be long. Did you enjoy this? Did you get comments or views? Did you find the blog helpful to your learning? Did you find it cumbersome? Which parts did you feel best about and which did you feel less certain about?
I liked writing a blog post. I've never had to do it before so it was interesting.  I also want to improve it with some CSS, make it look like a legitimate blog site. I think once I get the hang of it more I won't find it as cumbersome.
