1. This project I decided to do in a pair session with Ariel Fogel. I think the thing we still struggled with at the end was figuring out how to put a link inside an image.  We nested the image in the link, but I would like to know how to do it the other way as well. 
2. HTML is pretty easy to use.  Usually when you type the code in cases like sublime the close tag automatically comes up, which is very helpful. 
3. The difference between classes and ids was solidified for me.  We also both had to remember that color names need a # in front in order to work. 
4. I didn't have any additional resources.
