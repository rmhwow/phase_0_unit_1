 1. I learned the difference between websites and web applications. Websites are static and aren’t updated often where as web applications rely on you to interact with them and are constantly changing.  I also learned about IP addresses versus Doman names.  The IP address is a given computer’s or website’s address online and tells other computers where to send the information you are looking for.  A domain name is the “English” name for that site.  The best analogy is a phone book.  The IP address is the phone number and the domain name is the name of the person.  So you can type in the person’s name (domain) and reach them at their number(IP address). 
2. This might be sort of obvious, but actually having the <html> </html> tags!  Also making sure you have a body is definitely key.  In my version of sublime another important factor is making sure the sublime is set to “HTML” in the lower right hand corner. 
3. I high fived myself.  It’s a skill I’ll be able to show you guys once we get to DBC.  It was awesome though and got me more excited to keep learning. 

4. Aha moment.  Realizing that the repository folder was actually going to be the name of the website.  Figuring out that when you put things in your repository and you pushed them to github then they become saved and accessible online. Also once you push it to github it becomes a real site! I also learned that when you open the repository in the terminal or on sublime you’re asking it to open all the files.  As well as to open a file through the terminal you have to use the file extension otherwise it will be confused.  That was probably my biggest triumph and aha of this challenge! 
5. I didn’t find any resources.  On this challenge I honestly didn’t really look elsewhere because the resources here were really helpful.
