## Release 5: Reflection
//The tutorials were really helpful.  They were a nice addition to have, the thing I have been struggling with this week is getting comfortable with the terminal.  I thought this challenge definitely helped ease some of that worry, I'm still learning where to think of things visually. I feel pretty competent in the learning competencies. The resources were definitely very helpful. Of course the more you do the more "tedious" it can become but I just thought of that as good practice.
